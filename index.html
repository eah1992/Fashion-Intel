<p><em>(A still from the Nine in the Mirror homepage)</em></p>
<p><strong><h3>Katie Stalker, 24</p></strong>
<p><em>Editorial Assistant at Nine in the Mirror</h3></em></p>
<p>
I have always loved fashion and from four years old, I loved reading and writing.  As I grew older, I devoured glossies and copies of Vogue, just like my mum. We still shop for the latest looks together. </p>
<p>
Fashion always seemed natural to me, so, as soon as I could, I started interning. I worked at GQ, Storm Models, ES Magazine and Prima, whilst completing my honours degree in French and English Literature. At 16 years old, when I was at GQ, everything amazed me – even just being in London – and at ES Magazine I watched people read my bylines on the tube. That really built my confidence.</p>

<h2>"I had to get over my pride. That was really hard"</h2>
<h4>Katie Stalker, Nine in the Mirror</h4>
</em>
</div>
</div><p>
There were brilliant moments, but in between internships, unsure whether things would work out, I had to get over my pride. That was really hard. After Prima, I did excel-based temp jobs for nine months. I would have gone insane if I hadn’t also written bits of copy for small brands and my blog. </p>
<p>
Nine months ago, I became Editorial Assistant at a start up online magazine and e-commerce site for expectant women, Nine in the Mirror. It wasn’t the big publication I’d always dreamed of, but I am so glad I applied. Because it’s a start up, I have 100% more freedom than at a larger company. We are an editorial team of two and I create weekly stories based around motherhood and pregnancy, with a fashion and lifestyle twist. I interview prominent women in their fields and run shoots. We are encouraged to go with our ideas and make them happen, so I can pitch whenever I like and manage my own workload.
</p>
<p>
My editor, who worked at Marie Claire and Net a Porter, has the time to sit with me to do edits and let me in on her tips and tricks. She puts immense trust in me, and I’m extremely grateful for it. When she goes on maternity leave, I will take over her responsibilities as editor. That would never happen as a junior elsewhere. </p>
<p>
When you’re young and soaking up issues of Vogue, you think, “cool, I’ll work there, or at InStyle.” If your mum’s the editor, great. But if she isn’t, your chance is one in a million. I’d rather have an actual job and pick up hands-on skills than keep being a big magazine’s tea maker. There are so many other opportunities out there and you have to take them.</p>

 <em>(Tom Banham's top 5 tips to stand out as a fashion writer)</em>
<p>
</p>

<p>
When you’re starting out as a writer, jump around as much as you can – variety is everything and that comes down to motivation. I started out as Features Assistant Intern at GQ for six months, but my first proper industry job was Deputy Digital Editor at Men’s Health. Whilst I was there, I was offered a few print commissions and decided I’d say no to nothing. </p>

<h2>"I’d do my day job, pen freelance stories until 11pm, go to bed, get up at 2am and freelance till 7am before going to work. I’d almost die and sleep all weekend, but I got stuff done."</h2>
<h4>Tom Banham, FashionBeans.com</h4>
</em>
</div>
</div>
<p>
For four days every week I’d do my day job, pen freelance stories for publications like the Guardian and Wired until 11pm, go to bed, get up at 2am and freelance till 7am before going to work. I’d almost die and sleep all weekend, but I got stuff done and I got loads of bylines. Suddenly, people were sending me work, so I could relax. </p>
<p>
I became Associate Editor at Fashion Beans, a leading men’s style website, in September 2015. I manage short form pieces, which means commissioning, editing and writing, alongside organising our publishing schedule and Facebook. It’s like a start up, although we were recently bought by Arnicis (an American digital company). Start up’s are the way forward. It’s great to have experience at GQ or Elle, to see how big publishing houses work, but you don’t get to do much of value. Small places are always under-resourced, so they will instantly give you things to do. </p>
<p>
Online is a great place to start. GQ and Men’s Health both had to retrofit magazine content online and figure out how the Internet works. Our founder originally worked in SEO, meaning we had a strong skeleton to build on from the start. </p>
<p>
That’s why Fashion Beans is growing in a way that traditional publishing isn’t. Instead of having conversations about trying to do more with less, it’s, “can we have more money?” “Yes.” That’s exciting and rare. Our next goal is to start more engaging projects, like video and Facebook Live. Because of our small set up, we are flexible, can turn things around quickly and we don’t have to get things officially signed-off. </p>
<p>
When you’re young, always look for the new thing. In little online companies, you will progress faster, but also get experience at big magazines. People recognise GQ on your CV, but equally that you are now Features Editor somewhere, not assistant. Ultimately, it’s a better title.</p>
